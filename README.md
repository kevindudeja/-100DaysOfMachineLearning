# -100DaysOfMachineLearning
I took up the 100DaysOfMachineLearning Challenge! 

Day1 
  - Made this repository! Made a Commitment!
  - Completed Numpy Exercise (Section 5) in Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp from Udemy
  -  ***What is the Numpy library and why is it important?*** The Numpy Library is a Linear Algebra Library for Python. Many of the libraries in the PyData Ecosystem rely heavily on Numpy as one of their main building blocks.
  - Great Job!
  
Day2 
  - Holi
  - Started late. Completed Machine Learning Coursera Week 10 + Quiz
  - Read a blog on design + AI by Google
  - Need to follow Siraj Ravals Study Plan
  - Great Job!
  
Day3 
  - Completed Machine Learning Coursera Week 9 Videos + Quiz
  - Watched Video 6/11 of Python for Data Analysis - Pandas (Section 6) of Udemy Course
  - Read Paper[1]: "Normalization: a preprocessing stage"
  - Great Job!

Day4
  - Completed Pandas (Section 6)
  - ***What is Pandas library?*** Pandas is an open source library built on top of Numpy and allows for fast analysis and data cleaning and preparation.
  - In the Pandas Section of the Udemy Course, we went through what are Series, DataFrames, dropna() and fillna() for missing data, SQL operations like groupBy, Merging, some operations in Pandas and data input and output. 
  - Went through GSoC Organisations
  - Selected organisations:
    - RedHen Labs
    - CLiPS
  - Great Job!
  
Day5
  - Had a discussion cum chat with ML teacher on mathew correlation constant, extreme learning, what is linear regression and its statistical assumptions, precision and recall in terms of specificity and some other term.
  
Day6
  - Perfectionism got me depressed
  - Went through videos for MLP, Linear and Non-Linear SVM, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering
  
Day7
  - Got an intro to CNNs and Tensorflow
  - Continued with Hackerearth Competition
    - Balanced the dataframe with equal number of +ve -ve class examples
    - Submission Accuracy: 0.66914
  - TensorFlow has a learning curve
  - There's a lot going behing the classifier.fit(X,y) function
